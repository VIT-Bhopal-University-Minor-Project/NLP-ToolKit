# AI – at the core of everything we do

# Summarization – Extractive

# Summarize Text from News Articles, or upload an entire book as a text file. Or simply type out the text for summarization.

# Web App- Deployed using Heroku, a Cloud Application Platform

# HOW DO WE BUILD IT?

# INTRODUCING BERT

# A new, state of the art language representation model.

# A FULLY AI DRIVEN WEB APP

# A scalable web application deployed in Cloud that can perform Automatic Summarization and many other NLP tasks in the future.

# FLASK

# A lightweight Python web-framework for deploying trained models.

# Natural language processing (NLP) is a branch of artificial intelligence within computer science that focuses on helping computers to understand the way that humans write and speak.
With NLP, machines can make sense of written or spoken text and perform tasks like translation, keyword extraction, topic classification, and more.

# Introducing: NLP

# Upcoming Features

# Summarize news articles from links or summarize entire text files.

# Understanding Audience sentiment from text – where it is applicable and why is it needed.

# Summarization

# Classification - Sentiment

# SUMMARIZATION

__“Automatic text summarization is the task of producing a concise and fluent summary while preserving key information content and overall meaning”__

__ Extract Summary   from the text\.__

__ Generate new sentences from the original text\. __

# SUMMARIZATION FEATURES

# Text input will be taken from text files uploaded to the application.

# Text input will be taken though the form body

# INPUT TEXT FROM USER

# INPUT TEXT USING FILE UPLOAD

# NUMBER OF SENTENCES and Type of Summarization according to user Input

# INPUT TEXT FROM NEWS ARTICLE LINKS

# REAL TIME USAGE

# 02

# WHY BUILD a SUMMARIZER-APPLICATIONS:

# Summarization is the task of condensing a piece of text to a shorter version

# To reduce the size of the initial text while at the same time preserving key informational elements and the meaning of content.

# REAL LIFE APPLICATION FOR TEXT SUMMARIZATION

# NEWS SUMMARIZATION :-   The news summarization approach is divided into two, namely extractive and abstractive. Extractive summarization means identifying important parts of the text and making it verbatim produce a subset of sentences from the original text; while abstractive summarization reproduces important material in new ways after the interpretation and examination of texts .

# TEXT CLASSIFICATION :- Text clarification is the process of categorizing the text into a group of words. By using NLP, text classification can automatically analyze text and then assign a set of predefined tags or categories based on its context.

# QUESTION ANSWERING :- Question answering is a critical NLP problem and a long-standing artificial intelligence milestone. QA systems allow a user to express a question in natural language and get an immediate and brief response. Example :- Chat bot

# RESPONSIVE WEB APPLICATION

# A web development approach that creates dynamic changes to the appearance of a website, depending on the screen size and orientation of the device being used to view it.

# Technlogies Used

The programming language – brief intro

Version control – collaboration and dev\-ops\, brief intro\.

The lightweight web framework and its brief intro

CLOUD PLATFORM as a SERVICE\(PaaS\) for deployment of app\.

# Why use Python

_Python code is concise and readable even to new developers\, which is beneficial to deep learning projects\. Due to its simple syntax\, the development of applications with Python is fast\._

# 1.   Python code is readable for new developers.  2.   Python has a syntax that is easy to understand and friendly. 3.   Python comes with a wide variety of libraries like Pytorch, tensorflow.4.   PyTorch is an optimized tensor library primarily used for Deep Learning applications using GPUs and CPUs. It is an open-source machine learning library for Python, mainly developed by the Facebook AI Research team.

# FLASK

# Flask is a web application framework written in python, in simple terms it helps end users interact with your python code (in this case our deep learning models) directly from their web browser without needing any libraries, code files, etc.
                 Why Most ML models are deployed Flask enables you to create web applications very easily, hence enabling you to focus your energy more on other important parts of a ML lifecycle like EDA, feature engineering, etc.

# Advantages of Flask

# Scalable :- Its simplicity of use and few dependencies enable it to run smoothly even as it scales up and up.
Flexible :-There are very few parts of Flask that cannot be easily and safely altered because of its simplicity and minimality.Modularity :- Modular code provides a huge number of benefits. With Flask, you have the ability to create multiple Flask applications or servers, distributed across a large network of servers

# WHAT IS GIT

_Git_  _ is a free and open source distributed version control system designed to handle everything from small to very large projects with speed and efficiency\._

![](img%5CNLP%20ToolKit12.jpg)

Git is used to tracking changes in the source code

The distributed version control tool is used for source code management

It allows multiple developers to work together

It supports non\-linear development through its thousands of parallel branches

# Why Do We Need Git In This Project

__1\.      Distributed file__

__2\.      Perfect to work with others__

__3\.      Good documentation__

__4\.      Easy to use__

__5\.      Branches allows for simultaneous code versions__

__6\.      It's easy to revert your mistakes__

# HEROKU

Heroku is a container\-based cloud Platform as a Service \(PaaS\)\. It is an easy to use service to deploy\, manage and scale modern apps\.

Heroku supports several programming languages that are used as a web application deployment model\, including Java\, Node\.js\, Scala\, Clojure\, Python\, PHP\, and Go\. This means a variety of developers can look to Heroku for an inexpensive way to scale their application\, no matter their preferred development language\.

Projects created in Heroku are bound to repositories in GitHub\. Heroku’s integration with GitHub provides automated builds and deploys of the latest version of code\.

GitHub is a trusted repository of source code\, so Heroku’s integration with GitHub and other tools helps developers optimize their efforts and save stakeholders time and money over the course of development projects\.

__'Why build apps on a platform as a service \(PaaS\) versus an infrastructure as a service \(IaaS\)?__  __Think of it as the difference between choosing a move\-in ready condo or building a house from scratch\.'__

# Why Choose Heroku for Deployment

Choosing a cloud service for deployment is a requirement for modern application as they use a shared pool of computer resources \(servers\, storage\, programs\, and so on\) in the cloud\.

Heroku offers a fantastic service for scalable applications with an easy to use Git based system for Deployment\, Management and Scaling our application\.

A traditional cloud IaaS like AWS might have hundreds of configuration issues – Heroku makes managing and scaling our app as easy as pushing new changes to a repository\.

With multi\-language support in Python it makes it a perfect choice for an app with such scale and flexibility\.

# Sentiment Analysis: Using Bert

![](img%5CNLP%20ToolKit13.png)

# Sentiment analysis is a Natural Language Processing (NLP) technique used to determine whether data is positive, negative or neutral.

 Sentiment analysis is often performed on textual data to help businesses monitor brand and product sentiment in customer feedback, and understand customer needs.

# Types of Sentiment Analysis

# Graded Sentiment Analysis
Emotion detection
Aspect-based Sentiment Analysis
Multilingual sentiment analysis

__Graded Sentiment Analysis:__

_As The  polarity precision is important to us\, Therefore we might consider expanding your polarity categories to include different levels of positive and negative:_

# Very positive                        5
Positive                                4
Neutral                                 3
Negative                               2
Very negative                       1


It Is used on various platform like IMDb, Ecommerce Web-sites where end user rates a particular product or a thing or movie out of 5 stars.

Automatically analyzing customer feedback, such as opinions in survey responses and social media conversations, allows brands to learn what makes customers happy or frustrated, so that they can tailor products and services to meet their customers’ needs.
